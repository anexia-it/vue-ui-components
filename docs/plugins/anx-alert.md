The [AnxAlert Component](/vue-ui-components/#/Components/AnxAlert) is used to show alert messages on the screen. With the *AnxAlertPlugin* those alert messages can be shown programmatically. The plugin automatically renderst the *AnxAlert Component* .  

Attention:
By default, the alert is simply appended to the body, so please provide a *class* or *ID* as a second parameter.
with the help of a "querySelector" the alert message will be appended after the 'div'.

Optionally all other attributes are accepted as well 

For a documentation on how to use this plugin please refer to the [AnxAlert Component Documentation](/vue-ui-components/#/Components/AnxAlert).
